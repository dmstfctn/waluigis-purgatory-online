      <h2>Note 14: Sliding stage</h2>
      <p>
        Used for the second-to-last scene only, this stage features a side view reminiscent of 2D platformer games. Its multiple-floor design is loosely inspired by an etching of the Wieliczka Salt Mine made by Willem Hondius, which unwrap the internal mine space panoramically. The polish mine was a key architectural reference in building the six underground levels of purgatory (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oaD7iVhQuTiGl1s-X7r-nGkK6nbjy5fQ/view?pli=1" target="blank">Networked Worlds, 2024</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene is crucial to the resolution of the story, and the downwards sliding stage is a plot device, or deus ex machina, through which the illusion of W. ascending out of purgatory is literally and metaphorically created.
