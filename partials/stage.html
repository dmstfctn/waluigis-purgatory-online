      <h2>Note 5: Rotating Stage</h2>
      <p><em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em> features a large hexagonal stage that is able to rotate. As a traditional theatrical device, this type of stage is used to transition between scenes without the use of curtains or the need to respawn actors, allowing for simultaneous actions. Its design features six different sets that can be rotated into the audience's view with the press of a joystick button. Stage lights are both controlled in real time and programmable.</p>
