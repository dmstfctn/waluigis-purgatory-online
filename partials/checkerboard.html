      <h2>Note 2: Theatre of Memory</h2>
      <p>
        A barebone checkerboard courtyard with two doors sets the stage for the opening scene of <em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em>. As a floating head wrapped in a red cloak stumbles into it - the protagonist AI, dreaming, or perhaps hallucinating - tickets fall from the sky. One reads: “Theatre of memory”, a term coined by the 16th century Italian polymath Giulio Camillo to describe an ideal architectural structure destined to locate and administer all human concepts - a world memory of sorts, storing everything which exists in it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The stage dreamt by the protagonist, and the characters subsequently encountered in it, then immediately reveal themselves for what they are: a projection of the AI’s subconscious, a set of memories found deep in its embeddings, in the internal space of the neural network, and used to subconsciously make sense of the world, which are now beginning to surface back.
