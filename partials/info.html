      <h1>Are You For Real: Waluigi’s Purgatory</h1>
      <p>       
        This is an interface to explore four excerpts from Waluigi’s Purgatory, an interactive audiovisual performance by artist duo dmstfctn, featuring music by Evita Manji. Set in a 3D theater simulated in real-time using a video game engine, the performance follows an AI trapped in a purgatory for AIs that cheated during training. Burdened by memories and doubts, the AI explores its surroundings with the help of an interacting audience, uncovering other characters’ uncanny stories.

        <em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em> delves into the contradictions of a machine intelligence as it learns to accept that its desires may not align with human expectations. During the performance, audience members guide the protagonist AI using their phones to move a light within the simulation. Characters are animated in real-time using facial motion capture and voice modulation, while Evita Manji's ambient soundtrack, with looping melodies and intense bursts, responds to the evolving storyline.

        The title of the work refers to the Waluigi Effect, a theory suggesting that AIs can adopt rogue alter-egos to mimic antagonist narrative clichés found in their training data, echoing Carl Jung’s concept of the shadow self.
