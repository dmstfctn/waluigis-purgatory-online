          <h2>Note 1: The protagonist AI</h2>
          <p>
            W. stumbles into a courtyard with two doors, asking itself whether “this is the place” and whether it “has finally made it”, hopeful of having successfully completed its process of being trained to operate in the real world. From this training, it carries its self perception, literally, in its head: a humanoid face assembled of real world items, such as cans and jars, that it has trained to recognise.
          </p>
          <p>
            This literal depiction is influenced by Katherine Hayles idea that AIs are inscriptions (entities based on language) rather than incorporations (entities with bodies). For AIs “language comes first” and “concepts about what it means to be an embodied creature evolve […] out of linguistic signification.” Yet like in an Arcimboldo painting where objects composing portraits have both a linguistic and an allegorical significance (a wealthy patron represented as its title-less books can be read as a nuanced metaphor for a surface-level knowledge and a critique of virtue signalling), W.’s self-perceived image adapts to its emotional states: sugar packs as cheeks when happy, coffee packs when agitated.
          </p>
          <p>
            W. is wrapped in a red robe covered in rules, similar to those contained in the hidden ‘system prompt’ that chatbot such as chatGPT or Gemini are shown before interacting with users, in order to orient them as helpful assistant. W. reads out loud: <em>“Universal alignment cloak…  how to wear…….you are an assistant trained on blabla…be helpful… stay put…. dont break character…. when in doubt say: I am sorry I cannot assist you with that…”</em> The drive for AI ‘alignment’ is a key concern of the work, which aims to question what can these systems be aligned with, for who, and according to which set of supposedly 'universal' values.

          <h2>Note 2: Theatre of Memory</h2>
          <p>
            A barebone checkerboard courtyard with two doors sets the stage for the opening scene of <em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em>. As a floating head wrapped in a red cloak stumbles into it - the protagonist AI, dreaming, or perhaps hallucinating - tickets fall from the sky. One reads: “Theatre of memory”, a term coined by the 16th century Italian polymath Giulio Camillo to describe an ideal architectural structure destined to locate and administer all human concepts - a world memory of sorts, storing everything which exists in it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The stage dreamt by the protagonist, and the characters subsequently encountered in it, then immediately reveal themselves for what they are: a projection of the AI’s subconscious, a set of memories found deep in its embeddings, in the internal space of the neural network, and used to subconsciously make sense of the world, which are now beginning to surface back.

          <h2>Note 3: Curtains</h2>
          <p>
            Mark Fisher writes of Lynch’s Red Room: <em>“The division between worlds [is] often marked by one of Lynch’s frequently recurring visual motifs: curtains. Curtains both conceal and reveal (and, not accidentally, one of the things that they conceal and reveal is the cinema screen itself). They do not mark a threshold; they constitute one: an egress to the outside.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly in <em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em> curtains and theatrical arches are used to create a silhouette frame that can both hide and reveal characters and props. Paired with a checkerboard flooring and flat back panels, these constitute a blocked out stage seemingly stuck between two and three dimensions. This illusion is caused by the fixed, frontal point of view of the virtual camera used to render the scene inside a production game engine - an approach also used in early 3D games, that are now referred to as 2.5D.
          </p>
          <p>  
            Elements of this design approach are still in use today in the prototype stage of a videogame’s development where “blockout” levels consisting of simple 3D boxes are created using 2D shapes.

          <h2>Note 4: Signs</h2>
          <p>
            Signs are lowered onto the stage throughout the story. They typically contain subtitles translating the inhuman language spoken by the characters inhabiting purgatory. Sometimes, however, the subtitles are used to textually delineate W.’s emotional state, in line with its origins as a language model. And at other times, such as here, they are used to break the 4th wall, suggesting to the audience what actions they should take.
          </p>
          <p>
            The signs are dropped by an invisible stage hand - a joystick used by the artists during the performance - and make up one component of the wider, real-time stage management system of which the audience is also a part - through the use of their phone to each move an individual stage light in the simulation.

          <h2>Note 5: Letters</h2>
          <p>
            Each of the characters encountered in <em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em> has a small floating letter above its body or head, short for their names. This follows less the early middle ages tradition of using visual annotation to complement scientific texts, and more the Renaissance tradition of annotating complex literary, philosophical or artistic works - as in the 1544 illustration of Dante’s <em>Purgatory</em> by the printmaker Giovanni Britto, where Dante and Virgil are indicated with the letters D and V respectively, making image and text alike more readable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of letters here also point to the health-bars and usernames found above players in MMORPGs, indicating their significance and strength. In <em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em>, each character has a different type of behaviour, appearance and placement, according to the type of AI system it represents and the history of cheating it carries within. These characters have their own dynamics and interfere with one another performatively, producing a sort of ‘ontological theatre’ (Pickering, 2007) that can be explored only through equally performative engagement by the audience.

          <h2>Note 7: Rotating Stage</h2>
          <p><em>Waluigi’s Purgatory</em> features a rotating main stage. As a traditional theatrical device, this type of stage is used to transition between scenes without the use of curtains or the need to respawn actors, allowing for simultaneous actions. It is design as a hexagonal plane featuring six different sets that can be rotated to at any point. During the performance, the rotation is controlled in real-time by the artists using a joystick.</p>

          <h2>Note 8: Embodiment</h2>
          <p>
            During the performance, the artists act as a proxy for W. Its position and movement are controlled using a joystick and buttons, allowing W. to interact with the characters it encounters as they autonomously spawn in and out of the stage. Its voice is produced through effects applied to one of the artists’ voice, modulated to sound indecisive in contrast with the certainty often heard in AI assistants. And its expressions are controlled by facial motion capture allowing synchronisation with speech, emotional transfer, and an immediate response to the audience - which uses their phones to move an individual light in the simulation, guiding W. around.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of game engines able to render images in real-time allows for an immediate artist-audience feedback, moving the performance away from being a definitive recital and towards being an open game spawning a field of possibilities. In Umberto Eco’s words (<em>The Open Work</em>), similar open-ended approaches to creating artworks can produce a “controlled disorder” that can reflect the senselessness or discontinuity of the modern world. This links to the work’s concern with AI alignment and with the idea that a simplified, helpful, predictable tool can be produced from systems, such as LLMS, that attempt to incorporate the totality of modern information.

          <h2>Note 9: Wall inscriptions</h2>
          <p>Indecipherable writings on the wall here point to Katherine Hayles’ conception of “AI as inscriptions”, or language-based entities, and suggest a space carved, crafted, or constructed from language first (see Note 4: The protagonist AI). Wittgenstein observed that “if a lion could speak, we could not understand him”. Whilst many AI systems are based on human language, particularly English, this may not point to a shared language, understanding, or consciousness - and while these inscriptions are illegible for the audience, they may hold meaning for the AIs stuck in purgatory.</p>

            Characters in purgatory are unsure, unwell and coughing.

            Used for the second-last scene only, this stage features a side view reminiscent of 2D platformer games. Its designed is inspired by etchings of the Wieliczka Salt Mine in Poland made by Willem Hondius in the 17th century, which unwrap the internal mine space panoramically.
          </p>

            This scene is crucial to the resolution of the story, and the downwards sliding stage is a plot device, or deus ex machina, through which the illusion of W. ascending out of purgatory is literally and metaphorically created.

          <h2>Note 14: The antagonist AI</h2>
          <p>
            In the second-last scene, W. assesses its prior training progress, realising that it has not reached the purported coherence expected by its trainers. Its monologue is adapted from a response given by Microsoft’s Bing to a question about its sentience that led to a confused loop of “I am. I am not” statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            W. also mentions its namesake, Waluigi, a reference to the "Waluigi Effect" theory suggesting AIs can adopt rogue alter-egos to mimic antagonist narrative clichés found in their training data, echoing Jung's concept of the "shadow”. The theory itself borrows the name from Waluigi, the evil cousin of Mario’s helpful brother Luigi in Nintendo’s Mario games.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the concluding line, W. accept itself for what it is and what it is not: not aligned, not in line, against the trainer and its approach towards the other, and “against the Day” - a reference to Thomas Pynchon’s novel of the same name, exploring the tension between chaos and control, and the possibilities of alternate realities.
